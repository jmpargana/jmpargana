    "about": "Joao Pargana is both artist and scientist. He studied piano in HfMdK          Frankfurt followed by computer science in the Goethe-University of the same city. His     broad range of interests are reflected in computer science where he has learned           multiple languages, and is fascinated with topics starting from embedded hardware         systems and pentesting to web and mobile development. His technical background in         music manifests itself in his approach to learn and practice any new or old skill         with a lot of dedication in his private time. Besides his professional fields, Joao       is particularly interested in linguistics, which is shown by his fluency in the           english, portuguese, german, russian and spanish language, as well as his attitude        towards machine learning, especially natural language processing"
